# Automated Road-Tolling System

## Abstract

- In this decade-one of the main problems faced by the society is pollution, and one of the main factors causing it is the over-usage of vehicles in day-to-day life.
- The following points need to be checked:
  - The number of cars being used
  - Whether they get pollution checked
  - In which areas traffic jams occur more frequently

All this needs to be checked by the government.
Thus we have created a new Road tolling system in which the number plate of a vehicle is read by calling the camera-API, then we impose Image processing and then we match it with the stored Databases to extract any info. Needed on the  vehicle owner.
We can get the information on pollution checks, and also store the number of times the user crosses the toll set.
